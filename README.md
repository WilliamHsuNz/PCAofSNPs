# PCAofSNPs
This programme performs Principal Component Analysis(PCA) on Single Nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) data.  
The data is from a geographically structured population with unknown number of subpopulations.  The 
programme use PCA to determine the number of subpopulations and allocate individuals to each population.
The progamme outputs a location.txt file which can be subsequently plotted to show the subpopulations. 

The SNPs data are located at "https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci369s1c/resources/for-assig1/snps.txt"
